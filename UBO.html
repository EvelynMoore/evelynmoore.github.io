					<p>UBO is a party game prototype created in a team of 6, consisting of 2 programmers, 2 designers and 2 artists. I was the producer/project manager for this project, and also programmed the movement system and obstacles. The majority of the project was completed in June 2022, using Unity.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/UBOJPG.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The game is controlled with a single button per player (with a maximum of four players), and the main gameplay is a simple sumo style affair where the players attempt to bump each other off of the various levels, and the last one standing wins.</p>
					<p>The twist in the gameplay is there has been a malfunction at the space theme park, and all of the bumper cars are stuck spinning around forever! The only input the players have is to hold down the button to charge up power, and when they release it, the car is launched forwards!</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/UBOgameplayGIF.gif" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The one button mechanic makes for fun gameplay where timing your forward boosts is vital. The charge of the boosts is shown with arrows which extend out of the bottom of the cars.</p>
					<p>The game is compatible with controllers, keyboards and mice, and features an animated comic style cutscene at the start of the game to explain the basic premise.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/UBOcutsceneGIF.gif" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Three levels are featured in the game, each with their own unique mechanics. The slime level has a pool of slippery slime in the centre, the mushroom level has giant mushrooms which players will bounce off with extreme speed, and the construction level has barriers which prevent the players from falling off of the stage, but break after a single hit.</p>
					<p>The game also has a custom skybox with assorted space-themed models floating around the main platform as a way to make the game feel immersive as well as being chaotic fun.</p>
