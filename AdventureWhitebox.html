					<h1>Adventure Game Whitebox</h1>
					<p></p>
					<p>A whiteboxed level for an action adventure game (along the lines of Uncharted) made for a university assignment. I worked in a team of two to create two linked levels - I was responsible for the second level.</p>

					<p>We decided to go with scaling a tower as the basis for the second level, because it defines an extremely clear goal in the players mind as soon as they see the tower, meaning there's no need to explain the goal in a way that would detract from their immersion.</p>

					<p>A major aspect of the level that didn't work initially was two moving platforms that the player had to time correctly to get on. They ruined the pacing as there was a good chance that the platform wouldn''t be there when the player arrived and they would have to wait for it. This was rectified by preventing the platforms from moving until the player stood on them.'</p>
